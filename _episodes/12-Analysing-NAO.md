# Research Questions
- What is the NAO; how is defined?
- How is the NAO resolved in CMIP6 models; compared with observations;  
   any trends? 
- NAO and stratospheric wind correlations?
- Is the NAO changing in a future climate? 
- Any impacts of ENSO and volcanic eruptions on the NAO? 


# Data
- CMIP6 model data, historical period (1850-2014 CE)
- Observations: NCEP CPC data
