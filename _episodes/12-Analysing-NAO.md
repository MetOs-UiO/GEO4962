# Introduction
  ## NAO
- What is the NAO?

- Stratospheric impact on the NAO:

# Research question ideas
- How is the NAO resolved in CMIP6 models; compared with observations; any trends? 
- NAO and stratospheric wind correlations?
- Is the NAO changing in a future climate? 
- Any impacts of ENSO and volcanic eruptions on the NAO? 


# Data
- CMIP6 model data, historical period (1850-2014 CE)
- Observations: [NCEP CPC data](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/nao.shtml)
                [NCDC NOAA figure and data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/nao/)
