# Introduction
## NAO
The NAO is the dominant atmospheric circulation pattern over the North Atlantic/Europe in winter-spring.

# Research question ideas
- How is the frequancy and strength of NAO in CMIP6 models? 
- How does it compare with observations? 
- Are the impacts on surface climate captured in the models?
- How is the NAO likely to change in a future climate? Under extreme climate change?Â 

# Data
- CMIP6 model data: monthly mean sea level pressure; geopotential height; temperature at surface, 500 hPa, and 50 hPa; precipitation
- CMIP6 experiments: historical, SSP585, piControl, abrupt-4xCO2
- Observations: [NCEP CPC data](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/nao.shtml), [NCDC NOAA figure and data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/nao/)
