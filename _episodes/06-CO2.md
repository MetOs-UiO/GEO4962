The goal is to double CO2 (EXPNAME=CO2): we need to change the namelist (change CO2 value to 800 ppm).  

### **Doubling CO2**: how to update my namelist?

Namelists can be changed before configuring and building CESM but it can also be done before running your long simulation case. Then, you cannot use xmlchange and update the xml files, you need to directly change the namelist files.  

To be able to double CO2, you first need to check the current CO2 value in your case directory.

<pre># Make sure EXPNAME is correctly defined! (here CO2)
export EXPNAME=CO2

cd ~/cesm_case/f2000.T31T31.$EXPNAME

cd CaseDocs
ls

atm_in           docn_ocn_in                  ice_modelio.nml  rof_modelio.nml
atm_modelio.nml  docn.streams.txt.prescribed  lnd_in           seq_maps.rc
chem_mech.doc    drv_flds_in                  lnd_modelio.nml  wav_modelio.nml
chem_mech.in     drv_in                       ocn_modelio.nml
cpl_modelio.nml  glc_modelio.nml              README
docn_in          ice_in                       rof_in
</pre>

In CaseDocs, you can find all your namelists for your experiment. To check the current CO2 value, you can edit atm_in (**do not modify it!**) and search for the word **co2vmr** inside the file **atm_in**.

<font color="red">On Abel:</font> 

<pre>grep -i co2vmr atm_in
</pre>

Change from co2vmr (year 2000) i.e. 367.0e-6 to 1468.0e-6 (4xCO2) in your user_nl_cam file (NOT in atm_in).

1.  Edit user_nl_cam and update its value.
2.  user_nl_cam is your case directory:

<font color="red">On Abel:</font> 

<pre>cd ~/cesm_case/f2000.T31T31.$EXPNAME
ls user_nl_cam
</pre>

![](../../images/co2_namelist.png)  

Then you can apply your changes and check again atm_in.

<pre>./preview_namelists

cd CaseDocs

# check and make sure your new value is set for cm2vmr

grep co2vmr atm_in
</pre>
