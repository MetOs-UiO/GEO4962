# Introduction
Sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are events in which the temperature of the polar stratosphere abruptly rises, accompanied by a disruption of the westerly winds in the polar vortex. SSWs are classified into four different types depending on the timing and severity of the event: Canadian, Minor, Major, and Final (WMO criteria; see lecture slides). The frequency of occurrence depends on the type of SSW and is dramatically different in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The most dramatic impact on the General Circulation of the Atmosphere appears with major midwinter SSW, which we are focusing on here.
Major SSWs are interesting examples of troposphere-stratosphere interaction. Not only are SSWs initially forced by upward-propagating waves from the troposphere, but the subsequent disruption of the polar vortex, in case of major midwinter SSW, can in turn also change the surface weather.

# Research question ideas
1. Frequency and timing of NH major SSWs: modelled versus observed
2. Major SSWs in the SH in present and future?
3. Impact of major SSWs on the surface climate?

# Data
Daily [ta, ua, zg] (at least available for NorESM2), [FUB dataset](https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/met/ag/strat/produkte/northpole/index.html)
