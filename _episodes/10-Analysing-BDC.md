# Introduction
## BDC and ozone
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44640857/111973529-df714200-8afe-11eb-8874-1e3cb88054e1.png)

# Research question ideas
- Do CMIP6 models capture the observed ozone and BDC characteristics?
- How will the BDC and ozone change in a future climate ? 


# Data
- CMIP6 model data, historical period (1850-2014 CE) and future scenario(s)
- Observations: reanalyses
