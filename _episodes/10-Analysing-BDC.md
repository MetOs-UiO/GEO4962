# Introduction
## BDC and ozone
 
![image width=200](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44640857/111971411-9cae6a80-8afc-11eb-8bac-ebf7059f2f79.png) 


# Research question ideas
1. Frequency and timing of NH major SSWs: modelled versus observed
2. Major SSWs in the SH in present and future?
3. Impact of major SSWs on the surface climate?

# Data
Daily [ta, ua, zg] (at least available for NorESM2), [FUB dataset](https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/met/ag/strat/produkte/northpole/index.html)
