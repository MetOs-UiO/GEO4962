# Introduction
## BDC and ozone
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44640857/111973469-cd8f9f00-8afe-11eb-877c-b8a6f90d0d5f.png)


# Research question ideas
1. Frequency and timing of NH major SSWs: modelled versus observed
2. Major SSWs in the SH in present and future?
3. Impact of major SSWs on the surface climate?

# Data
- CMIP6 model data, historical period (1850-2014 CE) and future scenario(s)
- Observations: reanalyses, Engel et al 2009
