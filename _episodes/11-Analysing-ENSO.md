The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Which includes two opposite phases of the climate pattern: El Niño and La Niña, 

The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) is NOAA's primary indicator for monitoring El Niño and La Niña.
The ONI tracks the running 3-month average sea surface temperature (SST) in the east-central tropical Pacific between 120°-170°W. Scientists call the area the Niño 3.4 region. A full-fledged El Niño or La Niña is indicated when the ONI exceed +0.5C or -0.5C for at least five consecutive months.
